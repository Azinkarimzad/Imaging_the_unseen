## Overview

This lesson introduces key concepts in subsurface imaging, focusing on the physical principles and signal-processing foundations behind imaging underground structures using geophysical data (e.g., seismic or GPR).

It serves both as an introduction for new learners and a refresher for those familiar with geophysics or imaging.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this episode, learners will be able to:

- Explain the motivation behind subsurface imaging
- Describe how geophysical waves interact with underground materials
- Understand basic signal behavior: reflection, refraction, attenuation
- Recognize the role of resolution and limitations in geophysical imaging

## 1. Why Subsurface Imaging?

Understanding the subsurface is critical for applications in:

- Engineering (e.g., foundation design, underground construction)
- Energy (e.g., locating reservoirs or geothermal sources)
- Environmental studies (e.g., contamination mapping, groundwater)

But the underground is **invisible** â€” we rely on indirect methods like seismic or radar to "see" below the surface.

## 2. Basic Physics Refresher

Hereâ€™s what learners should recall or get introduced to:

- **Wave propagation** in different media (acoustic/electromagnetic)
- **Impedance contrasts** and what causes reflections
- **Time vs. depth domain**: why we record in time and convert later
- **Resolution limits** and what "sub-resolution" means

> ðŸ’¡ *Visuals like diagrams of ray paths, reflection at interfaces, and wavelets help a lot here.*

## 3. Imaging Principles

- What do we mean by "imaging"?
- Differences between raw data and an image
- Simple imaging methods: stacking, gain control, time-zero correction
- Intro to more advanced concepts (migration, deconvolution)

## Exercise (optional)

Ask learners:

> Sketch a basic model of the subsurface and draw a wave path that reflects off a boundary. Label the travel time, depth, and the reflecting interface.
